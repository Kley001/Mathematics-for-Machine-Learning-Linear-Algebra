# # Gram-Schmidt process
# 
# ## Instructions
# In this assignment you will write a function to perform the Gram-Schmidt procedure, which takes a list of vectors and forms an orthonormal basis from this set.
# As a corollary, the procedure allows us to determine the dimension of the space spanned by the basis vectors, which is equal to or less than the space which the vectors sit.
# 
# You'll start by completing a function for 4 basis vectors, before generalising to when an arbitrary number of vectors are given.
# 
# Again, a framework for the function has already been written.
# Look through the code, and you'll be instructed where to make changes.
# We'll do the first two rows, and you can use this as a guide to do the last two.
# 
# ### Matrices in Python
# Remember the structure for matrices in *numpy* is,
# ```python
# A[0, 0]  A[0, 1]  A[0, 2]  A[0, 3]
# A[1, 0]  A[1, 1]  A[1, 2]  A[1, 3]
# A[2, 0]  A[2, 1]  A[2, 2]  A[2, 3]
# A[3, 0]  A[3, 1]  A[3, 2]  A[3, 3]
# ```
# You can access the value of each element individually using,
# ```python
# A[n, m]
# ```
# You can also access a whole row at a time using,
# ```python
# A[n]
# ```
# 
# Building on last assignment, in this exercise you will need to select whole columns at a time.
# This can be done with,
# ```python
# A[:, m]
# ```
# which will select the m'th column (starting at zero).
# 
# In this exercise, you will need to take the dot product between vectors. This can be done using the @ operator.
# To dot product vectors u and v, use the code,
# ```python
# u @ v
# ```
# 
# All the code you should complete will be at the same level of indentation as the instruction comment.
# 
# ### How to submit
# Edit the code in the cell below to complete the assignment.
# Once you are finished and happy with it, press the *Submit Assignment* button at the top of this notebook.
# 
# Please don't change any of the function names, as these will be checked by the grading script.
# 
# If you have further questions about submissions or programming assignments, here is a [list](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/discussions/weeks/1/threads/jB4klkn5EeibtBIQyzFmQg) of Q&A. You can also raise an issue on the discussion forum. Good luck!

# You can then use the code below to test out your function.
# You don't need to submit this cell; you can edit and run it as much as you like.
